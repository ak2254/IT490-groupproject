<h1>IT490 GROUP PROJECT</h1>

<h4>Often times people struggle with choosing a restaurant to eat at, this is a fun way for people to find new restaurants and make their decisions of eating out easier.
</h4>

<p>The is project is designed as a restaurant search/suggestion application using the Zomato api (https://developers.zomato.com/api). This app will feature a roulette style search that will allow users to search for restaurants based on location, name, cuisine and rating. Based on the users search criteria a matching restaurant will be selected, the user can then view details/menu of that restaurant. If they do not like the restaurant they can refresh and another restaurant will appear. They can repeat the roulette process until they find a restaurant that they would like to eat at. 
</p>

<h4>Our application will also incorporate login system which will allow each user to:
</h4>
<ul><li>Have their own page</li> 
<li>Be able to provide rating to restaurant 
</li>
<li>
If  visited?
<ul> <li>Will have it stored in their personal page 
 </li>
 <li>The rating will display on the personal page as well as public page </li>
 
 </ul>
<li> 
The application will also store the data on if the user has visited the restaurant before or not and when selecting (visit) it will take them to there personal room page where they can see information about their last visit or they have provided a rating 

</li>
