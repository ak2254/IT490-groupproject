<h1>IT490 GROUP PROJECT</h1>
<p> It is an search/suggestion application using the Zomato api (https://developers.zomato.com/api). This app will feature a roulette style search that will allow users to search for restaurants based on location, name, cuisine and rating. Based on the users search criteria a matching restaurant will be selected, the user can then view details/menu of that restaurant. If they do not like the restaurant they can refresh and another restaurant will appear. They can repeat the roulette process until they find a restaurant that they would like to eat at.
